# Goals of this course
* A brief intro to the philosophy of Al
* A brief intro to the breadth of ideas in Al
* General computer scientist
    * general tools to aid in attacking a new problem
* Serious AI enthusiast
    * A primer from which to launch advanced study


## Theory vs Modelling vs Applications
Lecture balance tilted towards modeling  
Assignment balance tilted towards applications  
Relatively few theorems and even fewer proofs  
Desired work — lots!  

* 1946: ENIAC heralds the dawn of Computing

## Introduction: Definition of AI Dictionary Meaning, Part-6
![alt text](image-24.png)

## What is intelligence
* Dictionary.com: capacity for learning, reasoning,
understanding, and similar forms of mental activity  
* Ability to perceive and act in the world  
* Reasoning: proving theorems, medical diagnosis  
* Planning: take decisions  
* Learning and Adaptation: recommend movies,  
learn traffic patterns
* Understanding: text, speech, visual scene  

## Intelligence vs Humans
* Are humans intelligent?
— replicating human behavior early hallmark Of intelligence
* Are humans always intelligent?
* Can non-human behavior be intelligent?

## Introduction: Definition of AI Thinking vs Acting Humanly vs Rationally, Part-7

![alt text](image-29.png)


## Thinking Rationally : laws of thought
* Aristotle: what are correct arguments/thought processes?
    * Logic
* Problems
    * Not all intelligent behavior is mediated by logical  
deliberation (reflexes)
    * What is the purpose of thinking?
    * Ans - Thinking should be purposeful

## Acting Humanly
* Loebner Prize
    * Every year in Boston
    * Expertise-dependent tests: limited conversation
* What if people call a human a machine?
    * Shakespeare expert
    * Make human-like errors
* Problems
    * Not reproducible, constructive or mathematically analyzable

## Acting rationally
* Rational behavior: doing the right thing
* Need not always be deliberative
    * Reflexive
* Aristotle (Nicomachean ethics)
    * Every art and every inquiry, and similarly every action  
and every pursuit is thought to aim at some good.

## Acting => Thinking?
* Weak Al Hypothesis vs. Strong Al hypothesis
    * Weak Hyp: machines could act as if they are
intelligent
    * Strong Hyp: machines that act intelligent have to
think intelligently too

> Systems that act rationally
What is rationality?

## Rational Agents
* An agent should strive to **do the right thing**, based on what  
it can perceive and the actions it can perform. The right  
action is the one that will cause the agent to be most  
successful
* **Performance measure**: An objective criterion for success of  
an agent's behavior
* E.g., performance measure of a vacuum-cleaner agent  
could be amount of dirt cleaned up, amount of time taken,  
amount of electricity consumed, amount of noise  
generated, etc.

## Ideal Rational Agent
"For each possible **percept sequence**, does  
whatever action is expected to maximize its  
performance measure on the basis of evidence  
perceived **so far** and built-in knowledge. "

* Rationality vs omniscience?
* Acting in order to obtain valuable information

## Examples : Formal Cognitive Tasks
* Games
    * Chess
    * Checkers
    * Othello
* Mathematics
    * Logic
    * Geometry
    * Calculus
    * Proving properties of Programs
* Engineering
    * Design
    * Fault Finding
    * Manufacturing planning
* Medical
    * Diagnosis
    * Medical Image Analysis
* Financial
    * Stock market predictions

## Examples - Perceptual Tasks
* Perception
    * Vision
    * Speech
* Natural Language
    * Understanding
    * Generation
    * Translation
* Robot Control

## What is artificial intelligence (algorithmic view)
* A large number of problems are **NP hard**
* AI develops a set of tools, heuristics,...  
    * to solve such problems in practice
    * for naturally occurring instances
* Search
* Game Playing
* Planning
* ...

## Recurrent Themes
* Weak vs. Knowledge-based Methods
    * Weak — general search methods (e.g., A* search)
        * primarily for problem solving
        * not motivated by achieving human-level performance
* Strong Al -- knowledge intensive (e.g., expert systems)
    * more knowledge less computation
    * achieve better performance in specific tasks
* How to combine weak & strong methods seamlessly?

* Logic vs. Probabilistic vs. Neural
    * In 1950s, logic dominates
        * attempts to extend logic
    * 1988 — Bayesian networks
        * efficient computational framework
    * 2013 — deep neural networks
        * powerful representation across modalities

Games
* Phase 2: Uncertainty (decision theory,
probabilistic knowledge representation),
Learning (reinforcement)
* Phase 3: Deep Neural Networks
